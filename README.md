# BARbarIAn
 Native AI for BAR

Install into the Spring Engine in the following location:
..your install path/Spring/Engine/[your latest engine version]/AI/Skirmish/

# The folder should be AI/Skirmish/BARbarIAn/0.xxx/
It's case sensitive and should be named exactly like this ^

When you play/use this engine, you are able to select this awesome Native AI for BAR.


Installation:

BARbarIAn works best with SpringLobby, so please get this if you don't already have it.
 
1. First join an online battleroom to automatically download the latest engine-version.
2. Check which version this is while downloading or go to your spring install folder (Windows default is DRIVE:/User.../Documents/My Games/Spring/engine/)
3. You'll find your latest engine version with the last 4 digits (f.e. 104.0.1-1551-g55f31b1 maintenance)
4. You need to download the 64-bit engine of this same version from https://springrts.com/dl/buildbot/default/maintenance/
5. Get the win or linux 64 bit version - usually the ...64-minimal-portable.7z is the best/easiest way (you need a unzipper/7z programm to unpack it)
6. Unpack this 64-bit file in a separate folder, next to the 32-bit version in Spring/engine/
7. Then open the 64-bit folder and select all, except unitsync.dll, and copy everything over into the existing 32-bit folder
8. Remove/delete the 64-bit folder
9. (re)Start Springlobby, which should work the same
Now you have the 64-bit (latest) engine version, which quite possibly will increase your in-game performance as well

You're not there yet.
You need to get the latest BARbarIAn file and put this inside the engine folder (the 'upgraded 32»64bit folder)

10. Download the latest BARbarIAn from Github: https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/BARbarIAn
11. Instructions are on Git as well, but you need to extract the 0.4 (or higher) version folder, into the following folder in /Spring/engine/[your latest upgraded 32»64bit engine folder]/AI/Skirmish/here
12. (re)Start Springlobby - now go to skirmish, be sure the latest engine version is selected
13. You can now add (as many) BARbarIAn AI's to your game as you want!
